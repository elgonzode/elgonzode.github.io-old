I search for a convenient way, to take notes online to a webpage. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is cool too for taking quick notes an it offers a [publish service](https://obsidian.md/publish) which does exactly that, but i hesitate to take the plunge and pay for that service.

Maybe this [github Repository](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) can help me test out things and it might get easier. I think no pictures or media files, but for now, i can live with that.
